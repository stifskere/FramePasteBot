A discord bot recoding in c# for the original FramePaste bot made in JS

### Downloading the bot

to download the bot you can download the code and [compile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/developer/visualstudio/csharp/language-compilers/compile-code-using-compiler) it by yourself

or go to the releases page and download a pre released version of the bot.

### Downloading the code

there are some packages used in this bot, some of them are private but you can find them in a folder inside the bot files preaplied to the project.

the following packages are needed to edit the bot:

| Package name       | Description                                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Discord.net        | The discord api wrapper used for the bot.                            |
| ColorCat (private) | A color converting class library made by my friend SenyorGato#7759   |
| System.Data.Sqlite | The database utility package used to write / read databases.         |
| Z.Expressions.Eval | Some eval utility, there is no much use for it so it may be removed. |

### Usage

after the bot is compiled/downloaded

If the bot is ran for the first time, it will create a config file, there isn't much config to do more than assign channels
but it is needed for the bot to work.

after you fill the config you can just leave the bot running, if there is any problem with it just ask Memw#6969 trough the [framepaste](https://www.discord.gg/WbCcVYpebY) discord server.

For the reaction roles it is a simple array with objects inside that contain 2 values

| Value           | Type   | Description                                                  |

| Description     | String | The role description shown in the embed                      |
| MenuDescription | String | The role description shown in the list selection description |


it should look something like this

```json
{
  "ReactionRoles": [{"RoleId": 0, "RoleName": "Role name", "Description": "Some nice description", "MenuDescription" : "Some nice description"}]
}
```

In the config there is also some level roles, since this is a port from another bot the level roles are well, pre made roles that have to be assigned.

all the level roles follow this dynamic standard inside Levels object, there is up to 15 levels

| Value    | Type  | Description                                                                     |

| Time     | Int   | This is the time in days the user needs to be in the server to reach the role   |
| Messages | Ulong | This is the number of messages that the user needs to have to level up to there |
